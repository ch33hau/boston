## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is an overview of listing in AirBNB at Boston, which we should be able to understand how the pricing works in this area.
The [data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston) was originally from Kaggle for a competition purpose, it consists of booking calendar, listing, and review data.

This project will try to resolve below questions:
1. Which neighbourhood has the most listing?
2. Price distribution by neighbourhoods.
3. What kind of rooms are popular?

And of course, some data cleaning will be performed before answering above questions.
